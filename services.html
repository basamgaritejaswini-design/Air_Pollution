            <p>
              Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges
              of our time. It occurs when harmful or excessive quantities of
              substances including gases, particles, and biological molecules
              are introduced into Earth's atmosphere, causing diseases,
              allergies, and even death to humans and other living organisms.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
              The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified air pollution
              as the single largest environmental health risk. According to
              recent studies, air pollution is responsible for approximately 7
              million premature deaths worldwide each year. The economic cost of
              air pollution is also staggering, with healthcare expenses and
              lost productivity reaching billions of dollars annually.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Major Sources of Air Pollution:</strong></p>
            <ul class="custom-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Transportation:</strong> Vehicles emit large amounts of
                carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter,
                particularly in urban areas where traffic congestion is common.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Industrial Activities:</strong> Manufacturing plants,
                power generation facilities, and refineries release various
                pollutants including sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds,
                and heavy metals.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Agricultural Practices:</strong> The use of fertilizers
                and pesticides, animal waste management, and crop burning
                contribute significantly to air pollution through ammonia and
                methane emissions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Residential Heating and Cooking:</strong> Burning of
                coal, wood, and other solid fuels in homes releases harmful
                particles and gases, especially in developing countries.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Natural Sources:</strong> While less controllable,
                natural events like volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and dust
                storms also contribute to air pollution.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mt-4">
              Understanding these sources is the first step toward developing
              effective strategies to combat air pollution and protect public
              health.

              <p>
                Air pollution is a major cause of respiratory diseases.
                Pollutants can irritate the airways, reduce lung function, and
                trigger asthma attacks. Long-term exposure leads to chronic
                obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema.
                Children and elderly individuals are particularly vulnerable to
                these effects.
              </p>
            </div>

                Cardiovascular System
              </h3>
              <p>
                Research shows that air pollution significantly increases the
                risk of heart disease and stroke. Fine particulate matter can
                enter the bloodstream, causing inflammation and narrowing of
                blood vessels. This leads to increased blood pressure, irregular
                heart rhythms, and a higher likelihood of heart attacks.

              <h3 class="fw-bold fs-5 text-primary mb-3">Cancer Risk</h3>
              <p>
                The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified
                outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic to humans. Long-term
                exposure to polluted air, particularly diesel exhaust and
                industrial emissions, significantly increases the risk of lung
                cancer and potentially other types of cancer.

              <p>
                Air pollution damages ecosystems through acid rain, which
                acidifies lakes and soils, harming aquatic life and vegetation.
                It contributes to global warming and climate change, leading to
                extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disruption of
                agricultural patterns worldwide.

              <h3 class="fw-bold fs-5 text-primary mb-3">Economic Impact</h3>
              <p>
                The economic burden of air pollution is substantial, including
                healthcare costs for treating pollution-related illnesses, lost
                productivity due to sick days, and reduced agricultural yields.
                Tourism and property values in heavily polluted areas also
                suffer significant negative impacts.

              <p>
                Beyond measurable health effects, air pollution reduces overall
                quality of life. It limits outdoor activities, decreases
                visibility, causes unpleasant odors, and creates psychological
                stress. Communities in highly polluted areas face daily
                challenges that affect their well-being and happiness.

              Moving away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like
              solar, wind, and hydroelectric power is crucial for reducing air
              pollution. Governments and businesses should invest in clean

              adoption, and phase out coal-fired power plants. Individual
              households can install solar panels and choose green energy
              providers to support this transition.
